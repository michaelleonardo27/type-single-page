 I have decide it to work with the font LAB DJR by David Jonathan Ross,During this process of making my LAB DJR font website, I encountered many obstacles that completely stalled me. I was on the verge of giving up, but I persevered and achieved my goal. During this course I decided to work with this font because it caught my attention a lot, since I am a big fan of the matrix movies.
 
  While working on this project I could see that this font had a lot of potential when it came to illustrating everything you can do with it. In this project we include a little about its history. A little about how it can be used and everything you can do with it. 
  
  In the hero section I was able to make the letters have animation thanks to the help of my teacher Lara Henderson, who was very patient since I didn't know much about these programs. We use programs called Visual studio code, HTML and CSS, where I was able to complete this wonderful website. 
  
  I was able to include what the alphabet is and the numbers one to ten so that the audience could see the different variations and some of the many symbols that are in this font family. This is a font that inspires me a lot of peace, I decided to use and replicate the times of the first computers, which only had green and pixelated letters.
  
   This font undoubtedly took a lot of work but in the end, I think it was worth it not to give up. This font is also an inspiration of my kids since my daughters and son are the driving force of my life. this project is really set me up for sucess in my design carrer. 
   
   I did use CHAPTGPT to write my history paragraph of this font. this font has lots of variation that i decide it to incorporated into this project, for example how the letter change the strokes making then look like objects symbols an more.
   
   I was trying deliver the 1980 old computer screen thinks that I  could awake feeling to some people and that Era.

    I think I gain lots of this font and his creator David Jonathan Ross.

    one think that make my projects stand out is the colors and the unique use of it.

    I decide to do my mocks up with figma, because that was a app I never use before, making my self work hard to learn the tools to create my mock up.

    this project its my first website, it was really challenging and also frustrated, because i was stock in te coding process.

    While doing this project I used Teacher Henderson's codes, for my own use. I had a lot of problems with this project but I think I achieved something that promises a lot.
